Server side: have RSA key pair (private.pem and public.pem) (generated by CMake)
Each client should have public.pem (received from server)

#Sequence diagram

Client                      Server
connect            ---->
                   <----    Respond with seed (random bytes)
v='Hello' XOR Seed
RSA(v, public.pem) ---->    vs=Try to decrypt RSA with private.pem
                            Expect (vs XOR Seed)='Hello'
                   <----    if yes ACK
                            else ERROR and terminate connection
WAIT for ACK
Generate IV & KEY
(random 32 bytes)  ---->    Try init AES chiper should be ok, ACK

File name,
BEGIN_FILE         ---->    ACK, Create file


              Many times

FILE_BLOCK,
encrypted data     ---->   Try decrypt, and save to disk. If ok ACK
.....

LAS_FILE_BLOCK
encrypted data     ---->   Try decrypt, and save to disk. If ok ACK
